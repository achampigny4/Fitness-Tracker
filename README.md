## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Acceptance Criteria

When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises on the `stats` page.

To deploy an application with a MongoDB database to Heroku, you'll need to set up a MongoDB Atlas account and connect a database from there to your application. Be sure to use the following guides for support:

  * [Set Up MongoDB Atlas](../04-Important/MongoAtlas-Setup.md)

  * [Deploy with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas](../04-Important/MongoAtlas-Deploy.md)


* Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!).

* Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process.
